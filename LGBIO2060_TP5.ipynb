        "In this tutorial, you will estimate the true state of a continuous variable. Like in the last session, this state evolves over time. Therefore, at each time step you will use both your prior knowledge and a new measurement. Your prior knowledge will consist of your previous posterior (the posterior of the previous time step), updated with the system dynamics. The continuous adaptation of the Bayes theorem on dynamical sytems is called a *Kalman filter*.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's try to track the trajectory of a fly ! The state we want to estimate is the x and y position. We know that the fly goes around in circles, i.e., we know the system dynamics. If we know the position at $t_1$, we can predict the position at $t_2$. However, the system dynamics is not totally deterministic, some noise is added to the system. Additionnally, we can observe the fly trajectory, i.e., take measurements. But, again, these measurements are noisy.\n",
