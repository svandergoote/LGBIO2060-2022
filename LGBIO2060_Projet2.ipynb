        "Patients can be in one of the three following states : healthy, hypertension or hypotension. The patient's health status is represented by the vector $S$, where each value $s_t$ represents the patient's status in day $t$. The government also provides you the transition probabilities between each state, based on data from the national public health department.\n",
        "\n",
        "You received the blood pressure measurements of 5 patients for 150 days. Those measurements are made with a new state-of-the-art tool. However, the design of this tool is not perfect (yet) and the measurements are very imprecise. Based on these data, you are asked to provide the probabilities of each state (hypertension, hypotension and healthy) at each timestep for the 5 patients. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, two drugs are available on the market. One aims to lower the blood pressure, the other increases it. At each moment, you need to determine if you should take a drug and which one. However, take into account that these drugs have a cost and that taking a drug when healthy represents a risk to make the situation worse.  \n",

M contains 150 measurements. Then, graphically represent the evolution of these probabilities. The way you plot these data is up to you, make it readable and interpretable (you do not necessarily have to represent all the time steps). \n",

A policy must be optimal in the sense that it maximizes the benefit (utility) and minimizes the cost. It simply consists in setting a threshold on your posterior belief. For example, \"*if I have more than 65% probability to have hypertension, I will take drug A*\" is a policy. We give you the 100 first true states to test different policies (i.e, different thresholds) and determine which one is the best. Indeed, with the true states, you can determine the impact of your actions and compute both the benefit and the cost. \n",
