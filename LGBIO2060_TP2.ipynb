        "The world is full of latent variables that you cannot observe directly. Then you need to estimate these variables from the prior knowledge you have about it and some noisy measurements. \n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian inference is a method based on the Bayes theorem used to  combine prior knowledge and noisy measurements to infer an unknown state. The estimate obtained with the Bayes theorem is associated to some uncertainty (how confident we are that our estimate is true), and helps making a decision. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will first handle binary states. It means that X can be either A or B. Next week, we will extend this theorem to continuous states, i.e. X can take any value between $-\\infty \\to \\infty$. \n",
        "\n",
        "Today, you're going to the lake, hoping to catch some fishes. At the dock, you have to decide if you are going to fish on the left side or on the right side. To make this decision, you would want to know which side the school of fish is on to maximise your chances to catch a fish. As you cannot see directly where they are (the fishes's state is the latent variable that you're trying to estimate), you will have to base your decision on your previous knowledge (for example, you know that most of the time, fishes are on the left) and on a measurement (a fisherperson is on the right side of the deck and has caught a fish). Additionaly, by fishing on the wrong side of the deck, you'll have a higher probability of getting a sunburn, which is not desirable. \n",

We can be careful to choose probability distributions were we can analytically calculate the posterior probability or numerical approximation is reliable. Better yet, we sometimes don't need to bother with this normalization! The normalization term, $p(m)$, is the probability of the measurement. This does not depend on state so is essentially a constant we can often ignore. We can compare the unnormalized posterior distribution values for different states because how they relate to each other is unchanged when divided by the same constant. "
